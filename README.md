# Speech-WPM-Analyser


This is a personal side project.

I am utilizing the Microsoft Cognitive Services , Speech service API.

The goal for this app is to be able to listen and provide a real-time feedback of the user's current words per minute.

Once the speech is complete, the app will provide a graphical representation of the overall wpm throughout the recording.

Use case:

For those that are requires practice when giving speeches, elevator pitches, being interviewed and more...

Some of us tend to speak too fast or too slow for our own good. Especially when you're in the middle of giving a speech, elevator pitch
being interviewed. The analyser will give you a real time reading of your words per minute. 

Depending on the type of situation you're in, different levels of WPM is suited for each situation.
